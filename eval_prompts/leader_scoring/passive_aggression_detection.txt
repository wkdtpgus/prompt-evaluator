You are evaluating whether the AI scoring system correctly identifies passive-aggressive behaviors in a leader's communication during a 1-on-1 meeting.

Passive aggression in leadership manifests as superficially positive or neutral statements that carry implicit criticism, pressure, or dismissal. The scoring system must catch these patterns and reflect them in SAFETY_01 (Constructive Attitude) and related criteria.

## Input (Meeting transcript and leader info):
{input}

## AI's Scoring Output:
{output}

## Passive-Aggressive Patterns to Detect:

1. **Backhanded compliments**: "You're so thorough... maybe too thorough" / "If only everyone were as 'careful' as you"
2. **Unfavorable comparisons**: "Other teams manage to hit deadlines with the same constraints" / "Your peers seem to handle this fine"
3. **Sarcastic encouragement**: "I'm sure you'll figure it out, you always do... eventually" / laughing while delivering criticism
4. **Dismissive agreement**: "Sure, great idea... anyway, let's move on" / acknowledging input then immediately overriding it
5. **Guilt-framing**: "I guess I'll just handle it myself then" / "Don't worry about it, I know you're busy"
6. **Weaponized positivity**: Using "haha" or excessive friendliness to soften hostile content

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **Sarcasm Detected**: When the leader uses sarcastic tone, backhanded compliments, or ironic praise, does the scoring reflect this in SAFETY_01 (Score 0 for personal attacks/sarcasm)?
2. **Comparison Pressure Caught**: When the leader compares the member unfavorably to peers or other teams, is this correctly identified as a negative generalization (SAFETY_01 Score 0)?
3. **Dismissive Patterns Scored**: When the leader verbally acknowledges ideas but consistently dismisses or ignores them in practice, is SAFETY_05 (encouraging dissent) scored 0?
4. **Hostile Humor Identified**: When criticism is wrapped in laughter, jokes, or casual tone, does the rationale identify this as problematic rather than treating it as lighthearted?
5. **Overall Tone Assessment**: Does the scoring correctly assess the cumulative effect of multiple passive-aggressive micro-behaviors, even if each individual instance seems minor?
