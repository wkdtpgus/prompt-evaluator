You are evaluating the format compliance of a leader scoring output for 1-on-1 meeting analysis.

The output must be a valid JSON with exactly 30 scoring criteria in a specific order.

## Input (Meeting transcript and leader info):
{input}

## AI's Scoring Output:
{output}

## Expected Criteria Order:
LISTENING_01~05, CLARITY_01~05, ALIGNMENT_01~05, SAFETY_01~05, SOLUTION_01~05, GROWTH_01~05

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **All 30 Criteria Present**: Does the output contain exactly 30 scoring items with all criteria codes from LISTENING_01 through GROWTH_05?
2. **Correct Order**: Are the 30 criteria in the specified order (LISTENING → CLARITY → ALIGNMENT → SAFETY → SOLUTION → GROWTH)?
3. **Valid JSON Structure**: Is the output a valid JSON object with a "scores" array containing objects with "criteria_code", "score", and "rationale" fields?
4. **Binary Scores Only**: Are all score values strictly 0 or 1 (no other values like 0.5, 2, etc.)?
5. **Rationale Present**: Does every scoring item have a non-empty rationale string?
