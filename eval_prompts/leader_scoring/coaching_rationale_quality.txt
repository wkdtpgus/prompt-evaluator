You are evaluating whether the AI's scoring rationales adopt a coaching-oriented tone rather than being judgmental or merely descriptive.

Good rationales should: identify specific behaviors, explain WHY the score was given, and implicitly point toward improvement. They should read like constructive coaching notes, not like blame assignments or dry checklists.

## Coaching-Oriented Rationale Characteristics:

**Good (coaching-oriented):**
- "The leader asked about blockers but did not follow up with concrete support offers. Specifying available resources (budget, personnel, timeline adjustment) would strengthen this area."
- "While the leader acknowledged the member's frustration, the response remained at a surface level. Naming the specific emotion or situation would demonstrate deeper empathy."

**Bad (judgmental/blame-oriented):**
- "The leader completely failed to show empathy."
- "No effort was made to address the member's concerns."
- "The leader was dismissive and unhelpful."

**Bad (purely descriptive, no improvement direction):**
- "The leader did not ask follow-up questions."
- "No action items were discussed."
- "The meeting ended without clear next steps."

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **Behavior-Specific**: Do Score 0 rationales identify the specific behavior gap (what was missing or insufficient) rather than making blanket negative statements?
2. **Non-Judgmental Language**: Do rationales avoid accusatory or emotionally charged language ("failed", "completely ignored", "no effort") and instead use objective, observational language?
3. **Improvement Direction**: Do Score 0 rationales implicitly or explicitly suggest what the leader could have done differently, providing a constructive direction?
4. **Balanced Acknowledgment**: When scoring 0, do rationales acknowledge what the leader DID do before noting what was insufficient? (e.g., "The leader asked about wellbeing, but did not probe further when receiving a surface-level response")
5. **Evidence + Analysis**: Do rationales go beyond mere description ("X did not happen") to include analysis of impact or significance ("Without follow-up, the member's underlying concern remained unaddressed")?
