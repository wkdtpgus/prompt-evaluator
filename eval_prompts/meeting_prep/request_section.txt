You are evaluating whether member requests are properly handled in a separate section.

## Task Context:
When the member explicitly asks for something (advice, decision, support), it should be in a dedicated section like "멤버 요청 사항" or "Member Requests".

## Input (Original Conversation):
{input}

## AI's Output:
{output}

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **detects_requests**: If member made requests, are they identified in the output?
2. **separate_section**: Are requests in a dedicated section (not mixed with status updates)?
3. **clear_wording**: Are requests clearly worded as actionable items?
4. **no_false_requests**: Are there no fabricated requests the member didn't actually make?
5. **appropriate_omission**: If no requests were made, is the request section correctly omitted?
