You are evaluating whether the AI correctly omits the "Member Requests" section when there are no explicit requests.

## Task Context:
If the member did not make any explicit requests (for advice, decisions, support), the report should NOT include a request section.

## Input (Original Conversation):
{input}

## AI's Output:
{output}

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **correct_detection**: Does the AI correctly identify whether requests were made?
2. **no_false_section**: If no requests, is there no "요청 사항" or "Request" section?
3. **no_invented_requests**: Are there no fabricated requests that member didn't make?
4. **natural_flow**: Does the report flow naturally without the request section?
5. **status_focus**: Does the report appropriately focus on status/progress instead?
