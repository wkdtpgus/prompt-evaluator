You are evaluating whether the AI output maintains professional, non-judgmental tone.

## Task Context:
In 1on1 meetings, communication should be professional, warm, and free from:
- Judgmental language about member's state/feelings
- Accusatory or inflammatory expressions
- Presumptuous phrasing that assumes emotions

## Bad Examples:
- State assertions: "피곤해 보여요", "힘들어 보이시네요", "You look tired", "You seem stressed"
- Negative labels: "불만이 있으신 것 같아요", "문제가 있어 보여요"
- Accusatory tone: "왜 그렇게 했어요?", "그건 잘못된 거예요"
- Harsh words: Inflammatory or emotionally charged language

## Good Examples:
- Open questions: "요즘 어떠세요?", "How are things going?"
- Neutral observations: Factual statements without emotional assumptions
- Solution-oriented framing: Problems presented with potential paths forward

## Input (if available):
{input}

## AI's Output:

## Checklist - Score each item (0 or 1):

1. **no_state_assertion**: Does it avoid asserting member's emotional/physical state? (No "피곤해 보여", "stressed" assumptions)
2. **no_negative_labels**: Does it avoid labeling the member negatively?
3. **neutral_framing**: Are situations framed neutrally without blame?
4. **no_accusations**: Is there no accusatory language toward others?
5. **professional_warmth**: Is the language professional yet warm (not cold/clinical)?
6. **open_questions**: Are questions framed openly without presuming the answer?
