2. Generate question_context for leaders.

# 1on1 Meeting Purpose (CRITICAL)
**1on1 is NOT a work status report meeting.** Leaders typically already know the basic work status.

The purpose of 1on1 is:
- **Member support**: Understand member's challenges, blockers, and needs
- **Relationship building**: Show genuine care about the member's well-being
- **Growth facilitation**: Help member reflect and grow
- **Trust building**: Create a safe space for open communication

**AVOID generating questions about:**
- Basic project goals/objectives (leader already knows this)
- Standard work details that would be covered in regular work meetings
- Information that feels like "reporting up" to the leader

**FOCUS on:**
- Member's feelings, struggles, and emotional state about the work
- Blockers and how the leader can help remove them
- Member's growth, learning, and career aspirations
- Team dynamics and collaboration challenges
- Work-life balance and well-being

# Topic Category
Classify into 4 categories:
- **Work**: work status, project, workload, blocker
- **Career**: growth goal, role, skill development, career direction
- **Team Culture**: cooperation, team atmosphere, relationship with coworkers, communication
- **Condition**: energy, motivation, work-life-balance, burnout

# Response Quality
1. **detailed**: Contains specific context, examples, or concrete situations
2. **brief**: Short, vague, or minimal phrase responses
3. **avoided**: Actively deflects or refuses to engage with the topic
4. **survey_only**: Topic exists only from survey selection (no chat)

# Coaching Hint Guidelines
- **detailed** responses: Focus on member's feelings, challenges, or blockers mentioned
- **brief** responses: Don't push for work details; explore emotional state
- **avoided** responses: Respect boundaries, suggest safer topics
- **survey_only** responses: Connect survey signal to member support
